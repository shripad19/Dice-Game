# Dice Game

The Dice Game is a simple web-based game where two players roll dice, and the player with the higher roll wins. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Random Dice Rolls**: Each time the page is refreshed, two dice are rolled for Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Dynamic Dice Images**: The dice images change based on the outcome of the roll.
- **Winner Display**: Displays the result of the rollâ€”whether Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or if it's a draw.

## Files

- **`index.html`**: The HTML file that structures the content of the game.
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file that styles the game interface.
- **`index.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic and updates the dice images and winner announcement.
